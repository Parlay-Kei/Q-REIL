# PRD pointer — Q REIL v0.1

The canonical PRD for Q REIL v0.1 is **`docs/q-reil/PRD_Q_REIL_v0.1.md`**; its status is **LOCKED** and the current version is v0.1. All missions must explicitly reference PRD Section 6 (MVP Scope) and Section 10 (Definition of Done) or they are rejected; the enforcement rule and mission-header validator are in [OCS_RULES.md](OCS_RULES.md). This pointer file is stable and does not change; when people search for "PRD", they land here.
